    "# Assumptions:\n",
    "# 1. All cells are unblocked, until it observes them to be blocked.\n",
    "# 2. All path planning is done with the current state of knowledge of the gridworld under this freespace assumption\n",
    "# 3. There are three terrain types for unblocked cells: Flat(P), Hilly(H), Forest(F)\n",
    "# 4. Each terrain type has false negative rate: 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 respectively. There are no false positives.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Data Structures:\n",
    "# 1. grid (2D array): represents the full knowledge of the gridworld. Contains all blocked and terrain type of unblocked cells present.\n",
    "# 2. agent grid (2D array): represents the current knowledge of the agent. Gets updated according to the field of view of the agent\n",
    "# 3. pq (Priority Queue): will store the visited cells and will return them in increasing order of priority\n",
    "# 4. dirx[], diry[] : will store values to calculate the neighbouring nodes in N,S,E,W direction.\n",
    "# 5. p_containing (dictionary) : probability of the cell (key of dictionary) containing the target; gets updated when a block is encountered along the planned path or agent is not able to find target in the cell of 'assumed target'.\n",
    "# 6. fn (dictionary) : false negative values of the cell (key of dictionary) which are updated while travelling along the planned path (while discovering the cells).\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Pseudocode:\n",
    "# 1. Initialize each cell with probability 1/(dim x dim).\n",
    "# 2. Choose cells with highest probability first; if there are multiple cells with same probability then check for cell with lowest manhattan distance from the S. If again there are multiple cells with same distance then choose any cell as random. This cell will be 'assumed target' T.\n",
    "# 3. Start with S.\n",
    "# 4. Plan a path from S to T using the Manhattan distance heuristic.\n",
    "# 5. Start traversing on the path until a) you reach the 'assumed target' or b) you get blocked in that path.\n",
    "# 6. Once agent reaches the 'assumed target'; then agent will examine that cell for finding target.\n",
    "# 7. If you find the target, terminate the program and find the path.\n",
    "# 8. If you fail to find the target, update probabilites of every cell and repeat from step 2 with S as the most recent unblocked cell and 'assumed target' will change in step 2.\n",
    "# 9. If you see a block, then update probabilities of every cell and repeat from step 2 with S as the most recent unblocked cell and target will remain same(due to scaling).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Input:\n",
    "# 1. n is the dimension of gridworld (nxn).\n",
    "# 2. s is the string of length nxn that denotes the state of each cell in the grid world.\n",
    "# 3. If s[i] is 'X', then the cell is blocked.\n",
    "# 4. If s[i] is 'P', then the cell is unblocked with terrain type flat.\n",
    "# 5. If s[i] is 'H', then the cell is unblocked with terrain type hilly.\n",
    "# 6. If s[i] is 'F', then the cell is unblocked with terrain type thick forest.\n",
